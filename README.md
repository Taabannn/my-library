# my-library
### This is an implementation of the library management system.
<ul>
  <li>The management system contains an array of members and books (also how many are available).</li>
  <li>The attributes of the book are the name and unique identifier.</li>
  <li>The member attributes are name, date of birth, id (which is unique) and array of borrowed books.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The manager controls the library with these commands:</h3>


>      addBook [name] [count]
<b>1-</b> This command adds 'count' numbers of a book with name: 'name' to storage.<br>
(Assume that the maximum number of a book with common name is 50.)<br>
